        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p><b>Hypertext Markup Language <u>(HTML)</u></b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. <br><br> Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            mult imedia web pages.
            <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br><br> <u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With
            <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs,
            lists, links, quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by <i>tags</i>, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <span class="red">&#60;img /></span> and <span>&#60;input /></span> directly introduce content into the page.
            Other tags such as <span>&#60;p></span> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <u>HTML</u> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        </p>

        <H2>Markup</H2>
        <p><u>HTML</u> markup consists of several key components, including those called <i>tags</i> (and their
            <i>attributes</i>), character-based <i>data types, character references</i> and <i>entity references.</i>
            <u>HTML</u> tags most commonly come in pairs like
            <span>&#60;h1&#62;</span> and <span>&#60;/h1&#62;</span>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <span>&#60;img&#62;</span>. The first tag in such a pair is the <i>start tag</i>, and the second is the <i>end tag</i>            (they are also called opening
            <i>tags</i> and <i>closing tags</i>). <br><br>Another important component is the <u>HTML</u> <i>document
                type declaration</i>, which triggers standards mode rendering. <br><br>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:
        </p>
        <div id="main">
            <code>

            &#60;title&#62;<span>This is a title</span>&#60;/title&#62; 
        &#60;/head&#62; 
        &#60;body&#62; 
            &#60;p&#62;<span>Hello world!</span>&#60;/p&#62;
        &#60;/body&#62; 
    &#60;/html&#62;
