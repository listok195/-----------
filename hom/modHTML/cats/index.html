            <h1>Cat</h1>
            <p id=onea>The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species
                in
                the family
                Felidae
                and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family. The cat is
                either a
                house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact.[5] A house cat is
                valued by
                humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by
                various
                cat
                registries.

                <p>Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes,
                    sharp
                    teeth
                    and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most active at dawn
                    and
                    dusk
                    (crepuscular). Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those
                    made by
                    mice and other small animals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they see in near
                    total
                    darkness)
                    and have a better sense of smell, but poorer color vision. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are
                    a
                    social
                    species. Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations including mewing, purring, trilling,
                    hissing,
                    growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.[7] Cats also communicate by secreting
                    and
                    perceiving pheromones.

                <br>
                <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two
                    to
                    five
                    kittens. Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat
                    fancy.
                    Failure
                    to control the breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, has
                    resulted
                    in
                    large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird species, and
                    evoking
                    population control.
